# belly-button-challenge

## Overview

In this project, I used data from a study on bacteria in human belly buttons to develop a dashboard visually summarizing the bacterial makeup of each human sample. The dashboard features a dropdown list to select the human subject's ID number as well as a bar chart and bubble chart. The dashboard was published to the following GitHub Page: https://ahab91.github.io/belly-button-challenge/

## Credit
I used a skeleton code provided by the instructor to get started on building the dashboard.
